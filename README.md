# WindowsRice

My personal Windows and WSL configuration repository.

This repository includes an `autounattend.xml` file for unattended Windows installations, along with custom configurations for Windows, PowerShell, and WSL.

# Oh My Posh

Copy the PowerShell profile to:

```text
Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

Paste the profile contents into this file.

# Install WSL

## Install ArchWSL

2. Credits: https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL

4. Run `Arch.exe`.
5. Open the WSL instance and follow the initial setup steps.

## Run the Pre-Configuration Script

Copy `WSL/Install/Script/preconfig.sh` to your WSL environment and execute:

```bash
sed -i 's/\r//' preconfig.sh && bash preconfig.sh
```

---

## Run the Main Configuration

Copy the `WSL` directory to your home folder and execute:

```bash
sed -i 's/\r//' ~/WindowsDotfiles/WSL/Config/main.sh && bash ~/WindowsDotfiles/WSL/Config/main.sh
```

This script will apply the complete WSL configuration.

The main configuration also installs or updates the Codex CLI using the official
Linux installer. After installation, run:

```bash
codex
```

Sign in with ChatGPT when prompted. The shell configuration also provides `cx`
as a short alias for `codex`.

During an unattended Windows installation, the ChatGPT desktop app (with Codex)
is installed from the Microsoft Store.
